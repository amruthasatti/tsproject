	<h3>Impact in the Music Industry</h3>
	<font face="times new roman">
	
	<font color="purple">Taylor Swift, who has started out as a little country girl, has made a huge impact on the music industry. First off, Taylor has changed the way artists interact with their fans. Prior to her 1989 album release, Swift held a session known as "1989 Secret Sessions". Secret Sessions were basically parties with Taylor Swift in her houses around the world. She would invite about 100-300 people to her house and play her soon to be released album to fans prior before release. These fans were handpicked by Swift herself after she stalked them through social media site, Tumblr. By creating bonds with her fans like this Swift, influenced both major and upcoming pop artists to hold private sessions with fans.Some celebrities which followed Swift's footsteps include: Shawn Mendes, Camilla Cabello, Ariana Grande, and Marren Morris. In addition, Taylor also changed the way streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify reimburse recording companies. In 2015, Apple announced a new streaming platform known as Apple Music which offered users a free three month trial. Taylor penned out in an open letter that Apple Music was not paying writers, producers, or artists for the three month trial if people listened to their music.The open note lead Apple Music to pay their artists, and slowly streaming platforms such as Spotify started paying labels.Recently in December 2018, Taylor announced that she changed record labels, from 13-year long relationship with Big Machine Records to a contract with Universal Music Group and Republic Records. In her new copntract, Taylor wrote that she wanted her label to pay their artists all the money they earned from streams, even if the artist was in debt to the label. Not only is this profiting Swift, but it is also profiting young artists who are just starting their careers.</font>

	<h3> Impact in the Political World</h3>
	<font face="times new roman">
	<font color="red"> Taylor Swift has never been one to voice her political opinions, and she has gotten slammed the media for doing so. But recently, in the November 2018 elections Swift urged her 113 million Instagram followers to vote and told them the impact their vote had on society. Her post did not tell fans for what political party they should vote for, but rather it showed the world Swift's viewpoint on current controversies, and what she felt was right to represent the ideals of the American Dream. Swift continued to talk about Tennessee and the states candidates for senator, which was Marsha Blackburn and Phil Bredesen. Swift publicily stated that she supported Phil Bredesen for Senate, because Blackburn voted against women and the LGBTQ community. With Swift speaking out about voting 169,000 new voters registered into vote.org which ultimately is now known as the Taylor Swift Effect. </font>

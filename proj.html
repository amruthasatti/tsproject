	<font color="white"> Taylor Alison Swift was born December 13, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania to Andrea Swift and Scott Swift.At an early age Taylor was fond of musc. It was practically in her blood because her grandmother was an opera singer. Her parents later moved to Nashville, Tennesse to help Taylor continue her passion for music.Throughout much of her childhood in middle school and high school Taylor was bullied, but she got through it. Rather than keeping her emotions confined inside her, she started writing songs to express her feelings. Soon those feelings turned into platinum albums.</font>

Scott started Big Machine Records with Taylor by his side, his first recording artist.</font>

	<font color="maroon"> The 1989 album was released October 2014, and tour dates went on sale in December . For the 1989 tour tickets I had to cry to my parents for them to even consider letting me go to the tour. In the end, my friends and I convinced my parents and there's as well to let us get floor tickets for August 14,2015. The opening acts of the 1989 World Tour was Shawn Mendes and Vance Joy. The special guest that came for Santa Clara night 1 was Fifth Harmony and they sang 'Worth It', and the special song Taylor sang was 'Should've Said No'. At the concert, I met her mom, Andrea Swift and her backup dancers, Toshi and Maho.</p>

		<font color="maroon"><p> The reputation Stadium Tour had a different ticketing process compared to many of Taylor's other sales. Usually, tickets would be put on sale through TicketMaster and then fans and ticket bots would grab tickets as fast as they could. This process however resulted in many tickets being bought by bots and fans having to pay huge fees for tickets through the bots. With reputation, Taylor changed the marketing game. She had fans go through a system of boosts that upgraded their status in the priority line. Fans could boost their place in line by: buying merchandise, watching her YouTube videos, and buying her music. Fans with top priority got to buy tickets on the first day, on the first time slot. Slowly, as you were lower on priority you ticket buying date would be lower. Not only did this help keep scalpers away from buying tickets but it also allowed fans to get tickets for cheaper. By watching the YouTube videos Swift got paid, which ultimately helped lower some prices. </p>

<p>My experience with the boost system was great. Rather than having three different accounts, two of my bestfriends and I made one account and worked towards priority together. This helped us get tickets on the second day. When tickets came out I was in third period, and I had my dad buy tickets from home. Orginally, I was only supposed to go to the reputation tour on Friday, May 11, 2018 with my bestfriends, Rachel and Shreya but then my other bestfriend Bhavika Patel, got us tickets for night 2, Saturday, May 12, 2018.</p>
